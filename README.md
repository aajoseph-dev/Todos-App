Introduction:
The application is a web-based Todo List, providing users with a straightforward interface to manage and organize tasks efficiently. With an intuitive design and smooth user experience, it empowers users to keep track of tasks, mark them as complete, or add new ones as they see fit.

Technologies Used:

Next.js: The application leverages Next.js, a popular React framework that offers server-side rendering and generates static websites for React-based web applications. This ensures enhanced performance and SEO capabilities.
Prisma: As the primary database ORM, Prisma is used to interact with the application's database, making it easier to perform CRUD operations on todo items.
TypeScript: The code is written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that provides static types. This ensures a more robust codebase, enabling developers to catch errors early and improve the overall quality of the application.
Core Features:

Add Todo Items: Users can quickly add new tasks by navigating to the 'New' page. Each task requires a title, which is validated to ensure it's non-empty, providing better data integrity.
View Todo List: On the main page, users are presented with a list of their tasks. Each task is rendered as an individual Todo item, making it easy to view and manage tasks at a glance.
Toggle Task Completion: Each todo item comes with a checkbox, allowing users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete. This change is saved in the database, ensuring persistence of task status.
Intuitive User Interface: The application sports a modern UI, with actions like 'Add New Todo' easily accessible. Tasks are presented in a clean list format, and the UI components, like buttons and links, offer visual feedback on hover or focus, enhancing the overall user experience.
Server-Side Data Fetching: The application utilizes server-side data fetching capabilities provided by Next.js. This ensures that data (in this case, todo items) is fetched and rendered on the server before the page is sent to the client, resulting in faster page loads.
Conclusion:
The Todo List application is a testament to modern web development practices, utilizing the best of technologies like Next.js, Prisma, and TypeScript. Whether for personal or professional use, it offers a reliable platform for task management and organization.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
